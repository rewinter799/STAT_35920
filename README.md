# STAT_35920

Various computational assignments from STAT 35920 (Applied Bayesian Modeling and Inference), taught by Dr. Yuan Ji, at UChicago

* In Homework 3, we practice constructing a highest posterior density (HPD) credible interval using a simple example.
* In Homework 4, we practice implementing a Bayesian linear regression.
* In Homework 5, we write various Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling.
* In Homework 6, we write a reverse jump MCMC (RJMCMC) algorithm.
